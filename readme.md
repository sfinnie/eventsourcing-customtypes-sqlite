# Event Sourcing in Python with SQLite and custom domain datatypes

This project illustrates using the Python [eventsourcing](https://github.com/johnbywater/eventsourcing) library using:

* SQLite as a persistent datastore, and
* Custom domain datatypes using Pythons [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)

## Setup

1. Ensure you have [Python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  The example has been tested using version 3.8; no known reason why it won't work with anything later, though it's not been tested.
1. Clone this repository:

        $ git clone
